# TorBox Auto Downloader

This project automatically downloads torrents and NZBs from a watch directory using the TorBox API.

## Getting Started with Docker

### Prerequisites

*   Docker and Docker Compose installed.

### Configuration

1.  Set the `TORBOX_API_KEY` environment variable in your `docker-compose.yml` file. Replace the placeholder `API_KEY` with your actual Torbox API key.
2.  Update the volume paths in your `docker-compose.yml` file to match your local filesystem structure. 

**For Dual Directory Mode (Sonarr/Radarr):**
The default configuration uses separate directories for each:
- `/mnt/user/downloads/temp` mounted to `/app/watch` in the container
- `/mnt/user/downloads` mounted to `/app/downloads` in the container

The application will automatically create and watch subdirectories:
- `/app/watch/radarr` and `/app/watch/sonarr` for watch folders
- `/app/downloads/radarr` and `/app/downloads/sonarr` for completed downloads

**For Legacy Single Directory Mode:**
If you don't want to separate Sonarr/Radarr downloads, simply use `WATCH_DIR` and `DOWNLOAD_DIR` environment variables and the application will watch/download to those directories directly without creating subdirectories:
```yaml
environment:
  - WATCH_DIR=/app/watch
  - DOWNLOAD_DIR=/app/downloads
```
This will watch `/app/watch` and download to `/app/downloads` only (no subdirectories created).

### Running
1.  Clone Repo

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ArnoldWildt/torbox-auto-downloader
    ```
    
1.  Build the Docker image:

    ```bash
    docker build -t torbox_auto_downloader:local .
    ```

2.  Start the container using Docker Compose:

    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```

    To run in detached mode (in the background):

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

**Note:** Setting any of `RADARR_WATCH_DIR`, `RADARR_DOWNLOAD_DIR`, `SONARR_WATCH_DIR`, or `SONARR_DOWNLOAD_DIR` enables dual directory mode and causes `WATCH_DIR` and `DOWNLOAD_DIR` to be ignored.

## Local Development (without Docker)

1.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  Set the `TORBOX_API_KEY` environment variable and other environment variables as needed, for example in your shell before running.

3.  Run the application:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    Make sure you have created the `watch`, and `downloads` directories in your project root.

## Integration with Sonarr/Radarr

This project is designed to work with both Sonarr and Radarr simultaneously using separate watch and download directories for each.

**Configuration Steps for Radarr/Sonarr:**

1.  Go to **Settings** -> **Download Clients** in Radarr.
2.  Click the **+** button to add a new download client.
3.  Select **Torrent Blackhole** or **Usenet Blackhole** (or both, repeating these steps for each).
4.  Give the download client a descriptive name (e.g., "TorBox Torrent Blackhole").
5.  Set the **Torrent/Usenet Folder** to the Radarr or Sonarr watch directory (e.g., `/app/watch/radarr` for Radarr if using the default Docker configuration). This path must match the `RADARR_WATCH_DIR` or `SONARR_WATCH_DIR` environment variable inside the container.
6.  Set the **Watch Folder** to the Radarr or Sonarr downloads directory (e.g., `/app/downloads/radarr` for Radarr if using the default Docker configuration). This path must match the `RADARR_DOWNLOAD_DIR` or `SONARR_WATCH_DIR` environment variable inside the container.

**Note:** If you're running Sonarr/Radarr in Docker, make sure to mount the same host directories to both containers. For example, if you mount `/mnt/user/downloads/temp` to `/app/watch` in the TorBox container, you should mount the same `/mnt/user/downloads/temp` to a path in your Sonarr/Radarr containers and use the appropriate subdirectory paths.
