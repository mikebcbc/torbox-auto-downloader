# TorBox Auto Downloader

This project automatically downloads torrents and NZBs from a watch directory using the TorBox API.

## Getting Started with Docker

### Prerequisites

*   Docker and Docker Compose installed.

### Configuration

1.  **Create a `.env` file** from the example template:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  **Edit the `.env` file** and configure:
    - Set your `TORBOX_API_KEY`
    - Update `HOST_WATCH_PATH` and `HOST_DOWNLOAD_PATH` to match your filesystem

    Example:
    ```bash
    TORBOX_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
    HOST_WATCH_PATH=/mnt/user/downloads/temp
    HOST_DOWNLOAD_PATH=/mnt/user/downloads
    ```

    The host paths will be mounted as `/app/watch` and `/app/downloads` in the container.

**For Dual Directory Mode (Sonarr/Radarr):**
The default `.env.example` uses separate directories for each application.
The container paths are configured as:
- `RADARR_WATCH_DIR=/app/watch/radarr` and `RADARR_DOWNLOAD_DIR=/app/downloads/radarr`
- `SONARR_WATCH_DIR=/app/watch/sonarr` and `SONARR_DOWNLOAD_DIR=/app/downloads/sonarr`

The application will automatically create and watch these subdirectories.

**For Legacy Single Directory Mode:**
If you don't want to separate Sonarr/Radarr downloads, edit your `.env` file to use `WATCH_DIR` and `DOWNLOAD_DIR` instead:
```bash
# Comment out the Radarr/Sonarr variables and use:
WATCH_DIR=/app/watch
DOWNLOAD_DIR=/app/downloads
```
This will watch `/app/watch` and download to `/app/downloads` only (no subdirectories created).

### Running
1.  Clone Repo

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ArnoldWildt/torbox-auto-downloader
    ```
    
1.  Build the Docker image:

    ```bash
    docker build -t torbox_auto_downloader:local .
    ```

2.  Start the container using Docker Compose:

    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```

    To run in detached mode (in the background):

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

## Configuration (Environment Variables)

All configuration is managed via the `.env` file. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and customize as needed.

**Note:** Setting any of `RADARR_WATCH_DIR`, `RADARR_DOWNLOAD_DIR`, `SONARR_WATCH_DIR`, or `SONARR_DOWNLOAD_DIR` enables dual directory mode and causes `WATCH_DIR` and `DOWNLOAD_DIR` to be ignored.

## Local Development (without Docker)

1.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Create a `.env` file** from the example template:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3.  **Edit the `.env` file** and set your `TORBOX_API_KEY` and other environment variables as needed.

4.  Run the application:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    Make sure you have created the `watch`, and `downloads` directories in your project root.

## Integration with Sonarr/Radarr

This project is designed to work with both Sonarr and Radarr simultaneously using separate watch and download directories for each.

**Configuration Steps for Radarr/Sonarr:**

1.  Go to **Settings** -> **Download Clients** in Radarr.
2.  Click the **+** button to add a new download client.
3.  Select **Torrent Blackhole** or **Usenet Blackhole** (or both, repeating these steps for each).
4.  Give the download client a descriptive name (e.g., "TorBox Torrent Blackhole").
5.  Set the **Torrent/Usenet Folder** to the Radarr or Sonarr watch directory (e.g., `/app/watch/radarr` for Radarr if using the default Docker configuration). This path must match the `RADARR_WATCH_DIR` or `SONARR_WATCH_DIR` environment variable inside the container.
6.  Set the **Watch Folder** to the Radarr or Sonarr downloads directory (e.g., `/app/downloads/radarr` for Radarr if using the default Docker configuration). This path must match the `RADARR_DOWNLOAD_DIR` or `SONARR_WATCH_DIR` environment variable inside the container.

**Note:** If you're running Sonarr/Radarr in Docker, make sure to mount the same host directories to both containers. For example, if you mount `/mnt/user/downloads/temp` to `/app/watch` in the TorBox container, you should mount the same `/mnt/user/downloads/temp` to a path in your Sonarr/Radarr containers and use the appropriate subdirectory paths.
